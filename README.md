# Generative-AI--
This repository contains multiple Generative AI notebooks covering topics such as image denoising using autoencoders, model training workflows, inference experiments, and LLAMA temperature adjustments. It is designed as a hands-on exploration space for understanding deep learning, representation learning, and generative model behavior using Python and deep learning frameworks.
